# Guessing game

In this example, the user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The JavaScript code generates a random number between 1 and 100, and then listens for the user to submit a guess by clicking the "Submit" button. If the guess is too high or too low, a message is displayed indicating that the user needs to guess again. If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed and the input field and submit button are disabled. The "Reset" button allows the user to start the game again by reloading the page.
